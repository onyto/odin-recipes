      <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>»Spaghetti carbonaras are extremely popular – and more adulterated
          than almost any other pasta dish. Not only hobby chefs often use
          something in the preparation that does not belong in it, namely cream.
          Thanks to the eggs, the Italian classic also tastes so creamy enough
          and in combination with Pancetta bacon, pecorino, Parmesan cheese and
          freshly ground pepper absolutely heavenly.«</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>250 g</strong> uncooked spaghetti</li>
          <li><strong>100 g</strong> bacon</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> garlic clove</li>
          <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> olive oil</li>
          <li><strong>2</strong> egg yolks</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> extra egg</li>
          <li><strong>30 g</strong> grated pecorino romano</li>
          <li><strong>20 g</strong> grated parmesan</li>
          <li>salt, fresh ground pepper</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Cook spaghetti in salted water until firm.</li>
          <li>Dice bacon, peel garlic clove. Heat olive oil in a pan, sauté
            the garlic for about two minutes until golden brown over medium heat,
            then remove and fry the bacon in the oil until crispy.
          </li>
          <li>Whisk the eggs in a large bowl and mix with the cheese. Season
            with a little black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>Remove some pasta water from the noodles and drain the spaghetti.
            Immediately add to the bowl to the eggs and stir - so the eggs do not
            falter - and add the bacon and garlic oil from the pan.
          </li>
          <li>Season with pepper - preferably freshly ground - and, if
            necessary, salt.
          </li>

        </ol>
